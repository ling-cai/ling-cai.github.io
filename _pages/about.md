I am Ling Cai, a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href="http://stko.geog.ucsb.edu/">Spatial Temporal Knowledge Observatory (STKO) Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://people.geog.ucsb.edu/~jano/">Prof. Krzysztof Janowicz</a>, at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>.  Before joining UCSB, I obtained B.S. degree from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University </a> and my M.S. degree from <a href="https://english.cas.cn/">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. 

My <b> research interests </b> include Temporal Knowledge Graphs, Qualitative Reasoning and Inference, Points of Interest Recommendation, Geograhical Information Retrieval, Urban Computing, Cognitive Science and Semantic Web. Recently, I am particularly interested in the representation of and the reasoning about knowledge in representation learning. 

By comparing different ways of representing knowledge in symbolic AI (e.g., knowledge graph) and sub-symbolic AI (e.g., graph embedding methods), I am curious what the outcomes of such differences are, and how machines and humans could be mutually beneficial to achive real Artificial Intelligence for knowledge inference and reasoning. 

If you are interested in any related research topics, please <a href="mailto:ling.cai.geog@gmail.com<"> send me an email </a> without hesitation. I am always passionate about brainstorming great ideas and welcome potential collaboration!
