I am Ling Cai, a research staff member at IBM research. Before joining IBM in Jan 2023, I obtained my PhD degree at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>, supervised by <a href="https://people.geog.ucsb.edu/~jano/">Prof. Krzysztof Janowicz</a>. In addition, I held a B.S. degree from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University </a> and an M.S. degree from <a href="https://english.cas.cn/">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>. 

My <b> research interests </b> include Knowledge Represenation and Reasoning, Natual Language Processing and Recommendation Systems. Recently, at IBM, I am particularly interested in Large language models and machine unlearning.
